Hello! I am an M.S research scholar at the Indian Institute of Technology, Dharwad. I am a part of the Electrical Department, with interests in the field of machine learning. Currently I research Federated Learning, Reinforcement Learning and Deep Learning. This website was created to hold some blogs about various topics that interest me in various subjects and also to give a brief idea of what I like doing.
